                            I am an experienced data scientist, having worked in many data science and machine learning projects in finance and elevator maintenance industries. I believe I have a strong sense of integration between the data product developed by the data scientists and how the business operates with this product to generate revenue.

                            The focus of my studies for my Masterâ€™s Degree (and future PhD) is the use of deep learning techniques for image-based applications, such as computer vision and image synthesis with generative adversarial networks (GANs). I wish to use these skills beyond the scope of academic research to also impact businesses.
                        </p>
