abstract: [Paper in PT-BR only] Significant advances in image processing, computer vision, and computer graphics applications were recently achieved, much due to techniques based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Among those applications we can cite super resolution, image to image translation, style transfer, picture restoration and image synthesis. In this work we study the use of GANs in contour-to-image translation and face image synthesis applications. The first task involves transforming car sketches into realistic images, and cartoon sketches into a colorized and texturized version. We analyze and discuss the use of both Pix2Pix and CycleGAN architectures in this task, performing experiments with different parameters and configurations to enhance the quality of the synthetic image. In the synthesis application, inspired by image manipulation works, we explore how to generate synthetic images of human faces using conditional GANs as autoencoders, so that they can generate latent vectors that allow image manipulation directly on the feature latent space. We tested many combinations of different generators, discriminators, loss functions and training techniques to understand which elements contribute to generate better images.
