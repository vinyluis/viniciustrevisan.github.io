title: Fundamentals and Challenges of Generative Adversarial Networks for Image-based Applications
journal: 2022 35th SIBGRAPI Conference on Graphics, Patterns and Images (SIBGRAPI) Â· Dec 26, 2022
abstract: Significant advances in image-based applications have been achieved in recent years, many of which are arguably due to recent developments in <br>
          Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Although the continuous improvement in the architectures of GAN has significantly increased the quality  <br>
          of synthetic images, this is not without challenges such as training stability and convergence issues, to name a few. In this work, we present  <br>
          the fundamentals and notable architectures of GANs, especially for image-based applications. We also discuss relevant issues such as training problems, <br>
          diversity generation, and quality assessment (metrics).
