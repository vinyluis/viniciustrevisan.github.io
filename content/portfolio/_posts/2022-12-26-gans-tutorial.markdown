summary: Tutorial on GANs presented on the 35th edition of SIBGRAPI, named Fundamentals and Challenges of Generative Adversarial Networks for Image-based Applications.

---

On the 35th edition of SIBGRAPI (Conference on Graphics, Patterns and Images), in the city of Natal - Brazil, I presented a tutorial named **FUNDAMENTALS AND CHALLENGES OF GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL NETWORKS FOR IMAGE-BASED APPLICATIONS**.

The goal of the 3-hour long tutorial was to introduce researchers on the fundamentals of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and their applications for image processing, computer vision and computer graphics. As part of the presentation, a hands-on section of coding was made available on a [Github repository](https://github.com/vinyluis/GANs-Tutorial). The tutorial and paper were developed with the help of my avisors, [Jo√£o Paulo Gois](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-AYhiyQAAAAJ&hl=pt-BR) and [Bruno Dorta](https://scholar.google.com.br/citations?user=6mREjGgAAAAJ&hl=pt-BR).

The associated [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9991776) was later published on the congress publication, available on IEEE Xplore.

### Abstract
*Significant advances in image-based applications have been achieved in recent years, many of which are arguably due to recent developments in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Although the continuous improvement in the architectures of GAN has significantly increased the quality of synthetic images, this is not without challenges such as training stability and convergence issues, to name a few. In this work, we present the fundamentals and notable architectures of GANs, especially for image-based applications. We also discuss relevant issues such as training problems, diversity generation, and quality assessment (metrics).*
