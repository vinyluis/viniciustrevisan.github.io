I believe in giving back to the community and teaching newcomers useful stuff for their journeys. This is why I write articles about data science, machine learning and computer vision. 

My articles reach over 30k people from all over the world every month, and the associated codes are published for free in a [Github Repository](https://github.com/vinyluis/Articles) where people can practice and contribute.

Usually these articles are published on [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/), one of the biggest data science publications on medium, with hundreds of thousands of montly readers.
